Hi, Jerry. This is Sally from McDonald's. We've been facing some serious internet speed that she was at our restaurant and it's causing disruptions in our day-to-day operations. I am sorry to hear that. I understand the importance of the reliable internet connection for your business. Let's work together to resolve this to get started. Could you please provide me with your AT&T account? Number sure, our account. Number is secure info. Thank you. When did you first? Notice the slowdown in internet speeds, we've been experiencing this problem for the past few days and it's been getting worse. It seems to be more noticeable during the business hours. We've noticed a Slowdown on multiple devices including our registers tablets and smartphones noted. I recommend scheduling the technician to visit your restaurant location for an on-site inspection. How about we have a technician visit you or McDonald's restaurant tomorrow morning between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. that works for us. The definition of it is scheduled today will work toward resolving the internet speed that she was for your restaurant. Anything else is a lie? That's all for now. I appreciate your help in getting this issue. Addressed promptly goodbye.
